# m3ufilter

All docker images are single binary. The images are built using a [this pipeline](https://github.com/dfroberg/m3ufilter/blob/master/.travis.yml).

## Tags available

- latest, latest-386, latest-amd64, latest-arm, latest-arm64, v0.1-beta, v0.1-beta-386, v0.1-beta-amd64, v0.1-beta-arm, v0.1-beta-arm64

In the future, aside the `latest` tag, there will also be a `stable` tag, which will only include stable releases (no alpha/beta/nightly), as well as tags for major, minor and patch versions.

For more information on configuring the filter, see the project [README.md](https://github.com/dfroberg/m3ufilter/blob/master/README.md)
